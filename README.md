# Rock Paper Scissors

## What does it do?
At this time, not much! The progress so far is limited to a simple logic file which contains a small program that plays rock, paper, scissors against itself until either "player" wins.

## Goals
The current goal is to create an iMessage app where two players can duel against each other. There are existing applications already available that do the same thing, however they are clunky, don't have much visual appeal, and clearly weren't made by me.

The primary focus is just a simple rock, paper, scissors game. Once that is accomplished, there may be room to expand the game to include additional hand types (lizard, Spock, dynamite, etc.) to spice things up a bit.
